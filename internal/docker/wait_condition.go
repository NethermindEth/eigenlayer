// WaitConditionNotRunning (default) is used to wait for any of the non-running
// states: "created", "exited", "dead", "removing", or "removed".
//
// WaitConditionNextExit is used to wait for the next time the state changes
// to a non-running state. If the state is currently "created" or "exited",
// this would cause Wait() to block until either the container runs and exits
// or is removed.
//
// WaitConditionRemoved is used to wait for the container to be removed.
