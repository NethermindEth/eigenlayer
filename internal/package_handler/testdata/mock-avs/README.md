# Mock Tap

This is a mock package for an EigenLayer node software following the specification described [here](https://eigen.nethermind.io/docs/packaging/). It is used to test and demonstrate the node software package structure. The current services in the node software include a consensus client setup for Ethereum. Although this is not a genuine EigenLayer node software, it helps us to test the package structure. In the future, we will update the services to a real EigenLayer node software.
