# `pkg` package

We are following the [by-feature](https://phauer.com/2020/package-by-feature/) approach. This means that each feature will have its own folder inside the `pkg` directory and will be mutually independent.

To learn more about each feature, please refer to its corresponding `README.md` file, which should be located at the root of the package.
